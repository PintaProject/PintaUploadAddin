# Pinta Upload Add-in

This is an proof of concept add-in for uploading your images to internet hosting sites. The only upload type that has been implemented is the Imgur Anonymous upload.

##Notes

- It has a lib copy of the current Pinta.Core to build against, and it currently needs manual updating. (Need to look into automatic updates here.)

- For development purposes, the generated dll can be placed in Pinta's bin folder.

As with the rest of Pinta, this is licensed under the MIT/X11 license.
