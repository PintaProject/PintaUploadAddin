# Pinta Upload Add-in

This is an add-in for uploading your images to internet hosting sites. Currently, it only supports the simplest kind of imgur upload, but more advanced types could be coming if anyone wants to make them!

##Notes

- It has a lib copy of the current Pinta.Core to build against, and it currently needs manual updating. (Need to look into automatic updates here.)

- It's set up for upload to a Cydin server for easy distribution. For development porpuses, the generated dll can ba placed in Pinta's bin folder.
